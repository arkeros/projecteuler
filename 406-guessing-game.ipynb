    "<p>We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers {1, 2, ..., <var>n</var>} by asking questions. \n",
    "Each number (question) we ask, we get one of three possible answers:<br/></p><ul><li> \"Your guess is lower than the hidden number\" (and you incur a cost of <var>a</var>), or</li>\n",
    "<li> \"Your guess is higher than the hidden number\" (and you incur a cost of <var>b</var>), or</li>\n",
    "<li> \"Yes, that's it!\" (and the game ends).</li>\n",
    "</ul><p>Given the value of <var>n</var>, <var>a</var>, and <var>b</var>, an <i>optimal strategy</i> minimizes the total cost <u>for the worst possible case</u>.</p>\n",
    "<p>For example, if <var>n</var> = 5, <var>a</var> = 2, and <var>b</var> = 3, then we may begin by asking \"<b>2</b>\" as our first question.</p>\n",
    "<p>If we are told that 2 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of <var>b</var>=3), then we are sure that \"<b>1</b>\" is the hidden number (for a total cost of <span style=\"color:#0000FF;\"><b>3</b></span>).<br/>\n",
    "If we are told that 2 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of <var>a</var>=2), then our next question will be \"<b>4</b>\".<br/>\n",
    "If we are told that 4 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of <var>b</var>=3), then we are sure that \"<b>3</b>\" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 2+3=<span style=\"color:#0000FF;\"><b>5</b></span>).<br/>\n",
    "If we are told that 4 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of <var>a</var>=2), then we are sure that \"<b>5</b>\" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 2+2=<span style=\"color:#0000FF;\"><b>4</b></span>).<br/>\n",
    "Thus, the worst-case cost achieved by this strategy is <span style=\"color:#FF0000;\"><b>5</b></span>. It can also be shown that this is the lowest worst-case cost that can be achieved. \n",
    "So, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for the given values of <var>n</var>, <var>a</var>, and <var>b</var>.</p>\n",
