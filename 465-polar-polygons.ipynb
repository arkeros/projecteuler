    "<p>The <i>kernel</i> of a polygon is defined by the set of points from which the entire polygon's boundary is visible. We define a <i>polar polygon</i> as a polygon for which the origin is <u>strictly</u> contained inside its kernel.</p>\n",
    "<p>For this problem, a polygon can have collinear consecutive vertices. However, a polygon still cannot have self-intersection and cannot have zero area.</p>\n",
    "<p>For example, only the first of the following is a polar polygon (the kernels of the second, third, and fourth do not strictly contain the origin, and the fifth does not have a kernel at all):\n",

    "<p>Notice that the first polygon has three consecutive collinear vertices.</p>\n",
    "<p>Let P(<var>n</var>) be the number of polar polygons such that the vertices (<var>x</var>, <var>y</var>) have integer coordinates whose absolute values are not greater than <var>n</var>.</p>\n",
    "<p>Note that polygons should be counted as different if they have different set of edges, even if they enclose the same area. For example, the polygon with vertices [(0,0),(0,3),(1,1),(3,0)] is distinct from the polygon with vertices [(0,0),(0,3),(1,1),(3,0),(1,0)].</p>\n",
