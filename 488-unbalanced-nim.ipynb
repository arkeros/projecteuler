    "<p>Alice and Bob have enjoyed playing <b>Nim</b> every day. However, they finally got bored of playing ordinary three-heap Nim.<br/>\n",
    "So, they added an extra rule:</p>\n",
    "<p>- Must not make two heaps of the same size.</p>\n",
    "<p>The triple (<var>a</var>,<var>b</var>,<var>c</var>) indicates the size of three heaps.<br/>\n",
    "Under this extra rule, (2,4,5) is one of the losing positions for the next player.</p>\n",
    "<p>To illustrate:<br/>\n",
    "- Alice moves to (2,4,3)<br/>\n",
    "- Bob   moves to (0,4,3)<br/>\n",
    "- Alice moves to (0,2,3)<br/>\n",

    "<p>For an integer <var>N</var>, we define F(<var>N</var>) as the sum of <var>a</var>+<var>b</var>+<var>c</var> for all the losing positions for the next player, with 0 &lt; <var>a</var> &lt; <var>b</var> &lt; <var>c</var> &lt; <var>N</var>.</p>\n",
    "<p>For example, F(8) = 42, because there are 4 losing positions for the next player, (1,3,5), (1,4,6), (2,3,6) and (2,4,5).<br/>\n",
