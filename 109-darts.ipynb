    "<p>In the game of darts a player throws three darts at a target board which is split into twenty equal sized sections numbered one to twenty.</p>\n",

    "<img alt=\"\" height=\"400\" src=\"project/images/p109.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/></div>\n",
    "<p>The score of a dart is determined by the number of the region that the dart lands in. A dart landing outside the red/green outer ring scores zero. The black and cream regions inside this ring represent single scores. However, the red/green outer ring and middle ring score double and treble scores respectively.</p>\n",
    "<p>At the centre of the board are two concentric circles called the bull region, or bulls-eye. The outer bull is worth 25 points and the inner bull is a double, worth 50 points.</p>\n",
    "<p>There are many variations of rules but in the most popular game the players will begin with a score 301 or 501 and the first player to reduce their running total to zero is a winner. However, it is normal to play a \"doubles out\" system, which means that the player must land a double (including the double bulls-eye at the centre of the board) on their final dart to win; any other dart that would reduce their running total to one or lower means the score for that set of three darts is \"bust\".</p>\n",
    "<p>When a player is able to finish  on their current score it is called a \"checkout\" and the highest checkout is 170: T20 T20 D25 (two treble 20s and double bull).</p>\n",
    "<p>There are exactly eleven distinct ways to checkout on a score of 6:</p>\n",
