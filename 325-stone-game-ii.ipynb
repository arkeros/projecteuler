    "A game is played with two piles of stones and two players. At her turn, a player removes a number of stones from the larger pile. The number of stones she removes must be a positive multiple of the number of stones in the smaller pile.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "E.g., let the ordered pair(6,14) describe a configuration with 6 stones in the smaller pile and 14 stones in the larger pile, then the first player can remove 6 or 12 stones from the larger pile.\n",

    "<p>\n",
    "The player taking all the stones from a pile wins the game.\n",

    "A <i>winning configuration</i> is one where the first player can force a win. For example, (1,5), (2,6) and (3,12) are winning configurations because the first player can immediately remove all stones in the second pile.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "A <i>losing configuration</i> is one where the second player can force a win, no matter what the first player does. For example, (2,3) and (3,4) are losing configurations: any legal move leaves a winning configuration for the second player.\n",
