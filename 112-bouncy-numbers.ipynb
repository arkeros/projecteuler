    "<p>Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its left it is called an increasing number; for example, 134468.</p>\n",
    "<p>Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a decreasing number; for example, 66420.</p>\n",
    "<p>We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing a \"bouncy\" number; for example, 155349.</p>\n",
    "<p>Clearly there cannot be any bouncy numbers below one-hundred, but just over half of the numbers below one-thousand (525) are bouncy. In fact, the least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers first reaches 50% is 538.</p>\n",
