    "<p>A <b>geoboard</b> (of order <var>N</var>) is a square board with equally-spaced pins protruding from the surface, representing an integer point lattice for coordinates 0 &#8804; <var>x</var>,<var>y</var> &#8804; <var>N</var>.</p>\n",
    "<p>John begins with a pinless geoboard. Each position on the board is a hole that can be filled with a pin. John decides to generate a random integer between 1 and <var>N</var>+1 (inclusive) for each hole in the geoboard. If the random integer is equal to 1 for a given hole, then a pin is placed in that hole.</p>\n",
    "<p>After John is finished generating numbers for all (<var>N</var>+1)<sup>2</sup> holes and placing any/all corresponding pins, he wraps a tight rubberband around the entire group of pins protruding from the board. Let <var>S</var> represent the shape that is formed. <var>S</var> can also be defined as the smallest convex shape that contains all the pins.</p>\n",
